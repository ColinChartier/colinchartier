# Unconventional investing

Many people treat "investing" as a synonym for "stock investing", but that's an overly simple way to think about things.

The most common version of non-stock investing is the adage: "invest in an education" - this is obviously simplistic,
but starts getting to the real point of investing: Doing actions now that
yield large long-term returns in happiness and fulfillment for your life.

### Preamble

This is targeted to a younger (18-25) crowd, but the broader points are applicable at any age.

These thoughts are from the perspective of someone working in tech. 

### Level 1. Invest in yourself so that you can make more money

As mentioned above, the first derivative of investing is to improve your own skills, brand, or network - going to
university and finding mentors are good examples of this.

There's lots of clever ideas you can find here - I built [a 10' x 6' loft bed](/static/images/loft.jpg) with four 4k monitors under it while I was
building [LayerCI](https://layerci.com) initially. In total the monetary investment was $2000 for the lumber and the
monitors, but in return I had an extra 60 sq. ft of living space to share with my partner for years.

We bought a Counter-top dishwasher in that same small apartment to further reduce the amount of annoying
chores we had to do.

In general, if you find yourself frustrated by something (small living space, chores, lack of exercise, ...), there are
relatively cheap investments that will increase your chance at success for everything else you're trying to do in your
life.

### Level 2. Invest in a fulfilling future

Investing in stocks and investing in yourself have a similar purpose: Make more money.

However, beyond a certain point (~100k/yr according to some studies), money stops providing much happiness in your life.

Should you ever go on vacation? The thousands of dollars you spend now might be worth millions of dollars thirty years
from now. I think most would answer "I'd like to go on vacation every year or two" - but this is at odds with the "
maximize money at all costs" investing philosophy.

The paradox here is that you aren't actually investing for money, you are investing for the promise of fulfillment. With
enough money, you reason, you can own a house, take care of your parents, travel, and buy nice knickknacks.

However, humans are incapable staying in money-induced bliss. We are susceptible to
the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill). Beyond the basics (taking care of ourselves
and our families), every dollar will simply add more ultimately non-happiness-adding items to our lives.

You might be significantly happier at a job that pays ~100k but allows you to spend time with family and friends than
one that pays more but isolates you.

I chose to make a startup because it was fun - I enjoyed creating things and hard a hard time talking to users 
directly in regular development roles. It wasn't a monetary decision (I hoped, of course, that
I'd be successful enough to pay myself a salary). It was a fulfillment decision - I didn't want to have regrets
that I hadn't tried ambitious things when I was young enough to be able to risk it.


### Conclusion

All investments should lead to fulfillment - it's easy to mindlessly accumulate money (society gives us a number that
tells us how good we are!) but that isn't actually fulfilling a priori to the vast majority of people.

Think about how many years you have left with your parents. How many more picnics with them? How many more walks?

Think about relationships. Do you want to have kids? When will you meet your partner, and what will they do for work?

Think about experiences. Do you want to see the pyramids? How many countries will you visit before you die?

Ultimately you have to invest now to affect those outcomes. Don't make it a strictly monetary decision.
