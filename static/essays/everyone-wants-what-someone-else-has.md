# Everyone wants what someone else has

I occasionally mindlessly scroll through Linkedin to try to keep up with what the professional world looks like outside of my comfortable tech startup bubble. Often while scrolling I'll run across those "live-laugh-love"-esque motivational quotes which are endemic to the platform. I usually don't find anything particularly meaningful from the comics, but I once ran across a one which really resonated with me. The gist of that comic is the title of this post.

The basic premise is that there is no ultimate human which everyone looks up to - we all admire each-other and compare ourselves on different facets.  As a child, I was top of my tap dancing class and among the best of my friends at calculus, but I compared my friends' popularity with my lack thereof and felt that fate had put me at a charismatic disadvantage.

There was a cycle of impostor syndrome: I felt I was unpopular and uncharismatic in comparison to a friend, and that friend would feel inferior because they didn't win as many medals tap dancing as I did.
It's part of human nature to compare your shortcomings with others' strengths, and not vice-versa.

Before starting Layer, I yearned to have friends more in touch with entrepreneurship. I'd hoped they would choose to start a company with me instead of going off to tech giants. "It would be so much easier to succeed if I had an entrepreneurial sibling to co-found with me like Elon/Kimbal Musk or Patric/John Collison had."

I realize now that in a different timeline, those very people might've yearned to be born in Canada instead of South Africa / Ireland respectively, so that they could be closer to their support networks while creating their companies.

It's likely that you have at least one of the following attributes that someone you admire doesn't:
- Health
- A good relationship with your family
- Positive net-worth
- Born into a rich country
- Parents with networks that get you ahead
- A skin color or name that society isn't systematically racist against

The best way to avoid comparing yourself with others is to ruminate on the advantages you *were* born with.
Instead of comparing my weaknesses with others' strengths, I now just reflect on how much privilege I had to get to this point.
As an adult, I satisfy every one of those boxes without having struggled nearly as much as a vast majority of people would've had to.
