# Hi, I'm Colin

I'm co-founder at webapp.io, where we're merging staging servers, CI, and pull requests into a unified workflow for webapps

## Sanic
I also built [sanic](https://sanic.io) which we use for the deployment process at webapp.io - it lets you
build and deploy a bunch of Docker images to a kubernetes cluster with minimal effort.

## ParseHub
Prior to all of this, I was CTO at [ParseHub](https://parsehub.com) which is an excellent no-code webscraper
that you can use to scrape difficult websites, such as those with javascript or infinite scrolling.
