# Hi, I'm Colin, co-founder and CEO of webapp.io (YC S20)

At webapp.io, we're merging staging servers, CI, and pull requests into [a Continuous Staging](https://continuousstaging.com) workflow for webapps.

### 1. Create a Layerfile
These are based on Dockerfiles, but build entire staging VMs instead of just containers.

### 2. Install webapp.io
- [Log in](https://webapp.io/register)
- [Install Layer onto GitHub](https://github.com/apps/webappio/installations/new)

### 3. Every time you push a Layerfile, we'll create a new staging server per-commit for you in seconds

## Sanic
I also built [sanic](https://sanic.io) which we use for the deployment process at webapp.io - it lets you
build and deploy a bunch of Docker images to a kubernetes cluster with minimal effort.

## ParseHub
Prior to all of this, I was CTO at [ParseHub](https://parsehub.com) which is an excellent no-code webscraper
that you can use to scrape difficult websites, such as those with javascript or infinite scrolling.
